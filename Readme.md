# Quora question pair similarity


Our implementation is based on Python and is inspired by the following articles:

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01041.pdf
- https://aclanthology.org/P19-1465/

and these githubs repositories: 
- https://github.com/YuriyGuts/kaggle-quora-question-pairs

## Details of the used approach:
Our approach involves preprocessing the question pairs, extracting features, developing a BERT-based model for similarity prediction as well as a classical machine learning model, evaluating its performance using metrics, and iteratively improving the model based on error analysis.
